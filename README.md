# Questionable

Questionable is a program for running Jeopardy-style trivia games on your Mac. Use all kinds of USB devices as buzzers, like mice, gamepads or joysticks. Supports any number of players and up to five categories of questions. It's designed to work with one window for the players running full screen on a second display (like a projector) and the main display has the window for the host to control the game from.
