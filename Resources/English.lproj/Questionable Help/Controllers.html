			<h1>Controllers</h1>
			<p>
				This program works best with USB gamepads and joysticks as buzzers this page
				will tell you what you need to know about them.

				<h2>A Note About Using Mice as Buzzers</h2>
				<p>
				If you are running Questionable from a laptop and you are going to use mice as buzzers
				while you use the trackpad to control the game, make sure you turn off the preference
				for "Ignore trackpad when mouse is present." Otherwise your mice will work fine as buzzers
				but your trackpad will be disabled. This setting is in System Preferences under "Keyboard & Mouse."
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="figure">
				<h2>Types of Controllers</h2>
				<p>
					As stated in the <a href="RecommendedHardware.html">
					Recommended Hardware Configurations</a> page, Questionable supports USB keyboards, mice,
					joysticks, and gamepads to use as buzzers. This page only talks about gamepads and joysticks
					(from now on I'm just going to refer to them both as "controllers").
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have a PlayStation (1 or 2) you can buy some USB "converters" that will
					allow you to use a PlayStation controller on your computer via USB. This is actually
					what I use, and just about any one will do.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the more adventurous, you can take apart a single controller and solder wires
					and switches to the button pads to make a nice set of several buzzers from just
					one controller. I've made one myself that I use at parties and get-togethers.
					It's pretty simple and it works really well. Make sure you know some basics about
					electronics and soldering before starting, though (or have a friend who does).
				</p>

				<h2>Having Trouble?</h2>
				<p>
					This program allows the use of HID-class (Human Interface Device) USB peripherals
					of four different types: keyboards (not recommended, see: <a href="RecommendedHardware.html">
					Recommended Hardware Configurations</a>), mice, gamepads, and joysticks. Almost every single
					USB gamepad and joystick is an HID-class peripheral but some have quirks. If you
					have problems with a particular device not working, please let me know and I can
					try to add support for it.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The following lists of devices are not by any means comprehensive (one of my devices
					is an unmarked PlayStation to USB converter that works fine). These are just
					the devices that have been reported to me as working or non-working. A vast majority
					of USB gamepads and joysticks will work just fine. If you find one not on either of these
					lists I would appreciate it if you would contact me and tell me if it does or doesn't work.
					If it does not work, I should be able to make it work.
				</p>
