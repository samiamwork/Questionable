			<h1>Recommended Hardware Configurations</h1>
			<p>
				Questionable works on all Apple Computers running OS 10.4 (Tiger) and up, but some
				additional hardware will make the experience more authentic.
			</p>
			<div class="figure">
				<h2>A Second Display</h2>
				<p>
					While it is possible to play the game with a single display, you would end up
					with one of two problems: the players would be able to see the answers when
					they buzz in (if the host and player are looking at the screen), or the players would
					see nothing and the host would have to read everything to them (if only the host
					was looking at the screen).
				</p>
				<p>
					The best configuration is one with two displays: one that the host looks at as they
					face the players (usually the main display with the menubar) and a second
					display that shows the main game window in fullscreen to the players.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fortunately most Macs support secondary monitors in extended desktop mode. The
					only Mac currently produced that does <b>not</b> have support for a second display is the
					Mac mini. Most of these Macs also support TV-out so you can use a TV as your
					second display in a pinch, but this isn't recommended due to the low resolution
					of standard definition TVs. If you have  an HDTV you should be able to connect
					to it using either DVI (recommended) or VGA.
				</p>
				<p>
					Support for playing with a single display is in the works.

				<h2>Buzzers</h2>
				<p>
					Questionable supports four different devices to use as player buzzers:
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Keyboards *</li>
						<li>Mice</li>
						<li>Joysticks</li>
						<li>Gamepads</li>
					</ul>
				<p>* Keyboards are not really recommended because they're a bit akward as buzzers, but they do
				indeed work. The other three (especially mice) make fantastic buzzers.</p>
				<p>
					<b>NOTE:</b> When using keyboards and mice as buzzers, be sure to plug them in while Questionable
					is running. If you do not do this the system will treat them as normal mice and keyboards
					and may interfere with the running of the program.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also you'll probably want to
					use a USB hub though since most Macs don't have more than four USB ports You're probably already
					using one or two of them, anyway. It is also recommended that you get a powered
					USB hub so that the devices don't draw too much power causing the system to turn off the ports.
					It all depends on the devices you use.
				</p>
