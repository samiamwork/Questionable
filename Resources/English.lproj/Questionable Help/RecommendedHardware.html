			<h1>Recommended Hardware Configurations</h1>
			<p>
				Questionable works on all Apple Computers running OS 10.4 (Tiger) and up, but some
				additional hardware will make the experience more authentic.
			</p>

				<h2>A Second Display</h2>
				<p>
					While it is possible to play the game with a single display, you would end up
					with one of two problems: the players would be able to see the answers when
					they buzz in (if the host and player are looking at the screen), or the players would
					see nothing and the host would have to read everything to them (if only the host
					was looking at the screen).
				</p>
				<p>
					The best configuration is one with two displays: one that the host looks at as they
					face the players (usually the main display with the menubar) and a second
					display that shows the main game window in fullscreen to the players.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fortunately most Macs support secondary monitors in extended desktop mode. The
					only Mac currently produced that does <b>not</b> have support for a second display is the
					Mac mini. Most of these Mocs also support TV-out so you can use a TV as your
					second display in a pinch, but this isn't recommended due to the low resolution
					of standard definition TVs. If you have  an HDTV you  should be able to connect
					to it using either DVI (recommended) or VGA.
				</p>
				<p>
					Support for playing with a single display is in the works.

				<h2>USB Gamepads or Joysticks</h2>
				<p>
					Questionable supports three different devices to use as player buzzers: keyboards,
					joysticks, and gamepads. Support for keyboards was added as a last resort because
					any keyboard plugged in functions as the main keyboard. As such it would be possible
					for players buzzing in to do things like quit the program, or stop the game if
					they are not careful. Don't be too scared though, those things are pretty hard to
					do on accident. Also there will be a system beep any time a player tries to buzz in
					on the keyboard if players choose a key that normally produces a character (i.e.
					anything not a modifier key).
				</p>
				<p>
					Using a keyboard as a buzzer is really akward anyway. For this reason it is
					recommended that you use a USB gamepad or joystick. You'll probably want to
					use a USB hub though since most Macs don't have more than four USB ports (and
					you're probably already using one or two of them). These gamepads are pretty cheap
					and can be bought for as cheap as $5-$10 (US) or cheaper if they're used.
				</p>
