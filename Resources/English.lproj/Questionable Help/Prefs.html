					"Length of game" is fairly self-explainatory. This is how much time
					is allowed for the players to go through all the questions. Once
					this much time has passed (not counting time paused), the game will
					end immediately.
				</p>
				<p>
					"Time to answer question" is somewhat multi-purpose. It is the amount
					of time that players are given to buzz in when a question is shown.
					It is also the amount of time a player has to answer a question once
					they buzz in. If this time is too short for a particular question (i.e.
					if the question takes a long time to read) or you think a player needs
					more time to answer, pause the game and continue once you feel you
					have given enough time.
