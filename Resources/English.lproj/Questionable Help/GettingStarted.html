				<h2>Add and Configure Players</h2>
				<p>
					Click on the "Players" button in the <a href="HostWindow.html">host window</a> toolbar
					to bring up	the player list.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightPlayersTab.png" />
				<p>
					Add as many players as desired by clicking the plus (+) button.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightPlayersTabPlus.png" />
				<p>
					To change a player's name from the default of something like "Player 1," select them in the table and type the new name in the box at the bottom
					of the window.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightPlayersTabName.png" />
				<p>
					Assign a button to each participating player by selecting that player's name and
					pressing the "Set Buzzer" button.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightPlayersTabSet.png" />
				<p>
					A window will appear that will ask for the player
					to press a button. At this time, ask that player to press any button on their controller
					that they wish to use to buzz in.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightPlayersTabWaiting.png" />
				<p>
					After the window dissappears, the light next to
					that player's name should have changed from red to green.
					Repeat this for each participating player. If the light is still red
					please try again or check the <a href="TODO.html">Controller Troubleshooting</a>
					information).

				<h2>Press Play and Start the Game</h2>
				<p>
					When you press "Play," the controls view should be brought up automatically.
					If not, click the "Controls" button to bring up the controls view in the
					<a href="HostWindow.html">host window</a>.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightControlsTab.png" />
				<p>
					Make the <a href="InterfaceDetail.html">game window</a> fullscreen by clicking the "Fullscreen"
					item in the menu or by pressing command-option-f. Select the screen to fill in the sheet that
					appears over the <a href="InterfaceDetail.html">game window</a> and press the "Fullscreen" button
					at the bottom of that sheet.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightControlsTabFullscreen.png" />
				<p>
					Click "Play" in the toolbar to begin the game and the list of categories will
					appear in the center of the window.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightControlsTabPlay.png" />
				<p>
					Select the value of the question you want to
					show from the category you want by clicking the point value below the category
					title.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightControlsTabQuestion.png" />
				<p>
					When a question is clicked, the text of the question will replace the list of
					categories in both the <a href="InterfaceDetail.html">game window</a> and the "Controls" tab
					of the <a href="HostWindow.html">host window</a>. While a question is displayed, a player
					may buzz in using the button they selected on their controller previously. When
					they buzz in, the text of the answer will replace the text of the question and
					the name of the player that buzzed in will be shown in the box at the bottom of the window.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightControlsTabQuestionText.png" />
				<p>
					At this time, the player will try to give their answer before time runs out (as
					counted by the bars on the sides of the host game board). If the player manages
					to give an answer before time runs out, the host will click one of the two buttons
					on the bottom of the <a href="HostWindow.html">host window</a>. The host will click
					either the circle button for a correct answer, or the X button for an incorrect
					answer.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightControlsTabCorrect.png" />
				<p>
					If the player does not answer the question in time or answers incorrectly, the
					text of the question will return and the other players will be given the chance
					to buzz in. Players who previously answered the question incorrectly will not be
					allowed to buzz in to answer the same question again. They will have to wait for
					a new question.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you need to pause the game at any time please, click "Pause" in the toolbar.
					Press "Play" again to resume normal play when you are ready.
					If a player has buzzed-in and you are waiting for them to give an answer you can
					pause the game if you choose to give them more time to answer. The timer will resume when you
					either press the X or Circle buttons or press "Play" again.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightControlsTabPause.png" />
				<p>
					This will continue until either there are no more questions left to answer or time
					runs out for the game (as indicated by the timer in the toolbar).
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightControlsTabTimer.png" />
				<p>
					You can check players' scores at the end of the game by clicking on the "Players"
					tab in the <a href="HostWindow.html">host window</a> at any time.
