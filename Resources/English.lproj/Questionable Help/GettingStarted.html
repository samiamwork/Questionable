					that they wish to use to buzz in.

				<h2>Press Play and Start the Game</h2>
				<p>
					Click the "Controls" tab to bring up the control panel in the
					<a href="HostWindow.html">host window</a>.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightControlsTab.png" />
				<p>
					Make the <a href="InterfaceDetail.html">game window</a> fullscreen by clicking the "Fullscreen"
					button in the toolbar or by pressing command-option-f. Select the screen to fill in the sheet that
					appears over the <a href="InterfaceDetail.html">game window</a> and press the "Fullscreen" button

				<p>
					Select the value of the question you want to
					show from the category you want by clicking the point value below the question
					title.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightControlsTabQuestion.png" />
				<p>
					When a question is clicked the text of the question will replace the list of
					categories in both the <a href="InterfaceDetail.html">game window</a> and the "Controls" tab
					of the <a href="HostWindow.html">host window</a>. While a question is displayed a player
					may buzz in using the button they selected on their controller previously. When
					they buzz in the text of the answer will be replace the text of the question and
					the name of the player that buzzed in will be shown at the top.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightControlsTabQuestionText.png" />
				<p>
					At this time the player will try to give their answer before time runs out (as
					counted by the bars on the sides of the host game board). If the player manages
					to give an answer before time runs out, the host will click one of the two buttons
					on the right side of the <a href="HostWindow.html">host window</a>. The host will click
					either the circle button for a correct answer, or the X button for an incorrect
					answer.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightControlsTabCorrect.png" />
				<p>
					If the player does not answer the question in time or answers incorrectly then the
					text of the question will return and the other players will be given the chance
					to buzz in. Players who previously answered the question incorrectly will no be
					allowed to buzz in to answer the same question again. They will have to wait for
					a new question.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you need to pause the game at any time please click "Pause" in the toolbar at
					any time. Press "Play" again to resume normal play when you are ready.
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightControlsTabPause.png" />
				<p>
					This will continue until either there are no more questions left to answer or time
					runs out for the game (as indicated by the timer in the toolbar).
				</p>
				<img src="images/HilightControlsTabTimer.png" />
				<p>
					You can check players' scores at the end of the game by clicking on the "Players"
					tab in the <a href="HostWindow.html">host window</a> at any time.
